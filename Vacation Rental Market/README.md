# Project Overview:

This project involves the creation of a detailed 17-page spreadsheet encompassing raw data (hidden), processed data, data analysis, pivot tables, and a bar chart. Its primary aim is to discern the types of properties most suitable for targeting in the vacation rental market within the Manhattan borough of New York City, based on available Airbnb data.
### Assumptions:

  It is assumed that Airbnb rentals provide representative insights into general vacation rental statistics.
  Rental activity is inferred from the number of reviews received in the last 12 months.
  Properties lacking reviews within the last 12 months are considered inactive.
  Properties priced above $1,956.00 (super luxury listings) and below $82 (extremely low-priced listings) have been filtered out as outliers, each representing 1% of the dataset.
  Superhost properties are deemed indicative of the prices of properties the investor intends to acquire.

### Process:

The project methodology involved several key stages:

  Data exploration, filtering, and cleansing: Initial steps included exploring, filtering, and cleaning the dataset to ensure data integrity.
  Aggregations and pivot tables: Various aggregations and pivot tables were created to identify the most suitable property types for targeting.
  Occupancy and revenue calculations: Calculations, pivot tables, and charts were utilized to determine occupancy rates and estimate revenue.
  Optional analysis: An optional analysis was conducted to ascertain the significance of various property attributes in the vacation rental market.
  Formatting: Final formatting adjustments were made to enhance readability and ensure clarity for the client.

### Findings

  In summary, my analysis of the vacation rental market in Manhattan's Lower East Side reveals promising investment opportunities for our client. By scrutinizing Airbnb data and focusing on properties with ratings of 4.5 or higher, we've identified a segment characterized by consistent high occupancy rates and substantial annual income, particularly in two-bedroom accommodations. The observation that Friday is the most popular day for rentals further enhances the strategic potential of this market. We recommend prioritizing investments in this area, leveraging its reputation for quality accommodations and favorable rental dynamics. This analysis not only provides valuable insights for our client's decision-making process but also highlights the potential for lucrative returns in Manhattan's vibrant vacation rental market.
