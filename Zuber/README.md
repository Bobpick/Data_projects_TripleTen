# Project Overview:

This project entails a 6-step SQL query aimed at conducting exploratory data analysis to investigate whether the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport varies on rainy Saturdays. The primary objective is to discern patterns within the available data from competitors, shedding light on passenger preferences and the influence of external factors on ride durations.
### Assumptions:

  It is assumed that there is no direct link between the "trips" table and the "weather_records" table within the database.
  The "neighborhood_id" serves as the Primary Key for the "neighborhoods" table.
  The "cab_id" serves as the Primary Key for the "cabs" table.
  The "trip_id" serves as the Primary Key for the "trips" table.
  The "record_id" serves as the Primary Key for the "weather_records" table.

### Process:

The project methodology involved the following steps:

  Analysis of taxi rides by company for specific dates, sorted by trip count.
  Examination of rides for companies containing specific keywords, grouped by company name.
  Retrieval of neighborhood IDs for O'Hare and the Loop.
  Categorization of weather conditions by hour.
  Retrieval of rides from the Loop to O'Hare on Saturdays, including weather data and ride duration.
  Sorting of the obtained results for further analysis.
