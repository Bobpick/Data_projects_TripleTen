### This project comprises a comprehensive 9-page Tableau Visualization and Presentation, featuring data analysis, charts, dashboards, and stories. Its primary objective is to prepare an in-depth analysis for the CEO of Superstore, aiding in their understanding of the factors contributing to customer returns and proposing strategies to mitigate the volume of returned orders.
