# Zomato Customer Analysis Segmentation

## Description
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of Zomato's customer base through segmentation techniques. By leveraging demographic data obtained directly from Zomato's database, we aimed to identify distinct customer segments based on various factors such as age, gender, education level, income, and marital status. The insights generated from this analysis can inform targeted marketing strategies, product/service enhancements, and customer relationship management initiatives for Zomato.

### Features and Functionality:
- Segmentation of Zomato's customer base using demographic data.
- Identification of key customer segments based on age, gender, education level, income, and marital status.
- Insights to inform targeted marketing strategies and product/service enhancements.

### Problem(s) Addressed:
- Lack of targeted marketing strategies tailored to specific customer segments.
- Limited understanding of customer demographics and preferences.
- Challenges in optimizing customer relationship management initiatives.

### Findings and Insights:
- Customers categorized as having "no income" represent the largest segment, followed by families of 2 and 3 members.
- The age group between 21 and 24 emerges as the primary contributor to sales, indicating the significance of young adults in driving revenue for Zomato.
- Individuals with graduate and post-graduate degrees are the biggest spenders, outpacing other education levels by 5-6 times.
