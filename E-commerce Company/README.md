# Project Overview:

### As part of the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program, this project represents a significant milestone in my journey to master Business Analytics. It served as an independent endeavor, aimed at demonstrating the practical application of the skills acquired throughout the program.
Project Details:

  The project encompasses an extensive 8-page spreadsheet.
  It encompasses various sections including raw data (kept hidden), processed data, data analysis, and pivot tables.
  The primary objective was to delve into the raw transaction logs of the company and transform the event data into actionable business metrics.

### Assumptions:

  It is assumed that the "raw_user_activity" sheet accurately captures all website interactions within the specified timeframe.
  Any missing values or discrepancies in the dataset are considered minimal and inconsequential for analysis purposes.
  The format of the provided data, including columns and data types, is presumed to be accurate and consistent throughout.

### Workflow:

The project commenced with an initial phase of data exploration, filtering, and cleansing.
Subsequently, I constructed a comprehensive conversion funnel to track user interactions.
The data was then prepared for cohort analysis to discern long-term behavioral trends.
Retention rates were calculated to gauge customer loyalty and engagement.
Finally, meticulous attention was devoted to formatting and documentation, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation for the client.
