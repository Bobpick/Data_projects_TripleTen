# Project Overview:

This project consists of a comprehensive 7-page Tableau Visualization, comprising data analysis, charts, and a dashboard. Its primary aim is to provide consultancy to a company by conducting a thorough review of the store's operations and devising strategies to enhance profitability, thereby averting the risk of bankruptcy.
### Assumptions:

    It is assumed that profits from sales are currently experiencing negative totals.
    It is presumed that one or more factors contributing to negative profits are directly linked to orders and returns.
    Changes will need to be implemented by the Operations department to address these issues effectively.
    Recommendations will need to be provided to the Advertising department to optimize advertising strategies.

### Process:

The project workflow involved several key steps:

    Data consolidation: Sheets were joined to streamline data analysis.
    Identification of profit and loss centers: Various metrics were examined to pinpoint areas of profitability and loss within the business.
    Analysis of the impact of returns on profits: An investigation was conducted into how returns are affecting overall profitability.
