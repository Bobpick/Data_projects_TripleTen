# Project Overview:

This project encompasses the creation of a comprehensive Power BI Dashboard, spanning three pages. It integrates data analysis, key performance indicator (KPI) cards, and charts to provide insights into the Shopify platform's app ecosystem. The primary objective was to analyze publicly available data scraped from Shopify websites to discern the critical factors influencing the success of Shopify apps.**

### Project Details:

  The Power BI Dashboard comprises three pages, each dedicated to distinct aspects of the analysis.
  It incorporates various visualization tools, including KPI cards and charts, to present the findings effectively.
  The project's aim was to offer a detailed review of the Shopify app landscape, leveraging data extracted from publicly accessible Shopify websites.

### Assumptions:

  It is assumed that the data obtained from scraping Shopify websites accurately represents the broader landscape of Shopify apps.
  The dataset provided in the shopify.xlsx file is presumed to be comprehensive and consistent, with minimal discrepancies or missing values.
  The column names and data types in the tables within the dataset are believed to accurately reflect the content they represent.

### Workflow:

The project commenced with an initial exploration of the app store landscape, utilizing KPI cards and charts to highlight key metrics.
Subsequently, review data was cataloged and analyzed through the utilization of cards and charts, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of user sentiments.
Finally, an analysis of app developers across various review types was conducted, shedding light on developer performance and user feedback dynamics.
